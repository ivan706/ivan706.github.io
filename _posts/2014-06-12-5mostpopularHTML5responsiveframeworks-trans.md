================
## [HTML5 Boilerplate](http://html5boilerplate.com/)

> [Boilerplate is not a framework, nor does it prescribe any philosophy of development, 
it's just got some tricks to get your project off the ground quickly and right-footed.](http://html5boilerplate.com/)

Although it is not a framework I decided to mention it first because it is good starting
point for any HTML5 project.

It contains features that others don’t have e.g. cross-browser normalization,
performance optimizations, even optional features like cross-domain XHR and Flash.

## [Twitter Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/index.html)

> [Twitter Bootstrap is a free
collection of tools for creating websites and web applications. 
It contains HTML and CSS-based design templates for typography, 
forms, buttons, charts, navigation and other interface components, 
as well as optional JavaScript extensions.](en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter_Bootstrap)

Bootstrap is made with [LESS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LESS_%28stylesheet_language%29) at its core.

I like its 12-column grid system and amazing Javascript plugins, 
such as modal windows, tooltips, carousel and others.

## [Zurb Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/)

> [Foundation is the most advanced responsive front-end framework in the world. 
With Foundation you can quickly prototype and build sites or apps that work on 
any kind of device, with tons of included layout constructs 
(like a full responsive grid), elements and best practices.](github.com/zurb/foundation/blob/master/README.md) 

It’s a bit ambitious, isn’t it? I can only add it’s built with [Sass](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sass_%28stylesheet_language%29).

## [Skeleton](http://www.getskeleton.com/)

> [Skeleton is a small collection of CSS files that can help you rapidly develop 
sites that look beautiful at any size, be it a 17" laptop screen or an 
iPhone.](www.getskeleton.com)

I met some commercial templates that are built on Skeleton.

## [HTML KickStart](http://www.99lime.com/)

> [HTML KickStart is an ultra–lean set of HTML5, CSS, 
and jQuery (javascript) files, layouts, and elements designed to 
give you a headstart and save you 10's of hours on your next web 
project.](www.99lime.com)
